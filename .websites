Ping- Meet people near you.. An app for broadcasting your position (incentive) in order to display the positions of others around you along with the time of when they last pinged. You can then send messages to them or ping them (just an alert) which pushes a notification to their phone. Meet people and add them to your Friends list, making them show up as Green pins instead of Red. Also block pingers so that they can't see your ping icon on the map anymore or message you or anything.
